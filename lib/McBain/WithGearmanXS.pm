=head1 NAME
 
McBain::WithGearmanXS - Load a McBain API as a Gearman worker

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# write your API as you normally would, and create
	# a simple start-up script:

	#!/usr/bin/perl -w

	BEGIN { $ENV{MCBAIN_WITH} = 'WithGearmanXS'; }

	use warnings;
	use strict;
	use MyAPI;

	MyAPI->work('localhost', 4730);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<McBain::WithGearmanXS> turns your L<McBain> API into a L<Gearman worker|Gearman::XS::Worker>,
making it easy to consume your APIs with L<Gearman clients|Gearman::XS::Client>.

When your API is loaded, this module will traverse its routes, and create a queue for each
methods found. So, for example, if your API looks like this...

	package MyAPI;

	use McBain;

	get '/multiply' => (
		...
	);

	post '/divide' => (
		...
	);

...then the following queues will be created:

	GET:/multiply
	POST:/divide

The workers created receive payloads in JSON format, and convert them into the hash-refs your
API's methods expect to receive. Results are sent back to the clients in JSON as well. Note
that if an API method does not return a hash-ref, this runner module will automatically
turn it into a hash-ref to ensure that conversion into JSON will be possible. The created
hash-ref will have one key - holding the method's name, with whatever was returned from the
method as its value. For example, if method C<GET:/divide> in topic C</math> returns an
integer (say 7), then the client will get the JSON C<{ "GET:/math/divide": 7 }>.

=head2 CAVEATS

There are some disadvantages to using this runner:

=over

=item * Since a queue is created for every route and method in the API, C<McBain> cannot
intercept calls to routes that do not exist.

=item * You can't use regular expressions when defining queues. Well, you can, but they
won't work.

=item * Gearman provides no way of providing a detailed error message when jobs fail,
therefore all C<McBain> can do is indicate that the job has failed and no more.

=back

The first two I hope to overcome in a next version, or even a different runner, by creating
just one queue that simply forwards the requests to C<McBain>.

=head1 METHODS EXPORTED TO YOUR API

=head2 work( [ $host, $port ] )

Connects the Gearman worker created by the module to the Gearman server
running at the host and port provided. If none are provided, C<localhost>
and C<4730> are used, respectively.

The method never returns, so that the worker listens for jobs continuously.

=head1 METHODS REQUIRED BY MCBAIN

This runner module implements the following methods required by C<McBain>:

=head2 init( )

Creates the L</"work( $host, $port )"> method for the root topic of the API.

=cut

sub init {
	my ($class, $target) = @_;

	if ($target->is_root) {
		no strict 'refs';
		*{"${target}::work"} = sub {
			my ($pkg, $host, $port) = @_;

			$host ||= 'localhost';
			$port ||= 4730;

			my $worker = Gearman::XS::Worker->new;

			$class->_register_functions($worker, $pkg, $McBain::INFO{$target});

			$worker->add_server($host, $port) == GEARMAN_SUCCESS
				|| confess "Can't connect to gearman server at $host:$port, ".$worker->error;

			while (1) {
				$worker->work();
			}
		};
	}
}

=head2 generate_env( $job )

Receives the L<Gearman::XS::Job> object and creates C<McBain>'s standard env
hash-ref from it.

=cut

sub generate_env {
	my ($self, $job) = @_;

	confess { code => 400, error => "Namespace must match <METHOD>:<ROUTE> where METHOD is one of GET, POST, PUT or DELETE" }
		unless $job->function_name =~ m/^(GET|POST|PUT|DELETE):[^:]+$/;

	my ($method, $route) = split(/:/, $job->function_name);

	return {
		METHOD	=> $method,
		ROUTE		=> $route,
		PAYLOAD	=> $job->workload ? decode_json($job->workload) : {}
	};
}

=head2 generate_res( $env, $res )

Converts the result from an API method in JSON. Read the discussion under
L</"DESCRIPTION"> for more info.

=cut

sub generate_res {
	my ($self, $env, $res) = @_;

	$res = { $env->{METHOD}.':'.$env->{ROUTE} => $res }
		unless ref $res eq 'HASH';

	return encode_json($res);
}

=head2 handle_exception( $err, $job )

Simply calls C<< $job->send_fail >> to return a job failed
status to the client.

=cut

sub handle_exception {
	my ($class, $err, $job) = @_;

	$job->send_fail;
}

sub _register_functions {
	my ($class, $worker, $target, $topic) = @_;

	foreach my $route (keys %$topic) {
		foreach my $meth (keys %{$topic->{$route}}) {
			my $namespace = $meth.':'.$route;
			$namespace =~ s!/$!!
				unless $route eq '/';
			unless (
				$worker->add_function($namespace, 0, sub {
					$target->call($_[0]);
				}, {}) == GEARMAN_SUCCESS
			) {
				confess "Can't register function $namespace, ".$worker->error;
			}
		}
	}
}
